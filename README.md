# Build-your-own-computer-year1

BYOC, short for "build your own computer", is the first project I did in my first year at UCL. 

We drew logic diagrams using Quartus Prime and load it on to a FPGA for running. 

A demo video can be found here https://github.com/kellydingzx/Build-your-own-computer-year1/blob/master/A_12%20Submission/videoURL.txt .

The diagrams we did in Quartus Prime can be found here https://github.com/kellydingzx/Build-your-own-computer-year1/blob/master/A_12%20Submission/BYOC_A12.qar .

The mips code we wrote for running our simple computer can be found here https://github.com/kellydingzx/Build-your-own-computer-year1/tree/master/Code .
